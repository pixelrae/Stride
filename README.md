## Overview

Stride is a financial inclusion platform built for the UCT × Interledger Fintech Hackathon 2026 by Team Common Cents. It uses the Interledger Open Payments standard, which enables applications to interact directly with users’ wallets and move payments across providers through a shared standard.

The project strives to solve a problem in South Africa: many informal workers are paid in cash and have no verifiable income history, which makes it harder to prove earnings and access housing, credit, and basic financial services. Stride addresses this by turning each digital payment into a verifiable payslip and a portable record of income, creating a financial history that workers can use to prove what they earn.

Its impact goes beyond the hackathon use case. By giving informal workers a trusted record of payment, Stride can help workers move toward formal financial access, while also creating value for employers, lenders, landlords, and institutions that need reliable proof of income.

Every user must have an Interledger wallet address.

## Problem Statement

In South Africa, **5.7 million people were in informal employment in Q4:2025**, while the informal sector accounted for **21.4% of all jobs**. In addition, **1.9 million South Africans were running non-VAT registered businesses in 2023**. Many of these workers are paid in cash with no verifiable record of income, which makes it difficult to prove earnings.

Without verifiable income records or payslips, they often cannot:

- Rent formal housing.
- Qualify for loans or credit.
- Access basic financial services.
  
The informal economy remains essential to South Africa’s livelihoods, yet the people driving it are still financially invisible because their earnings rarely leave a formal paper trail.

## Our Solution

Stride combines three core tools into one platform.

| Feature              | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Digital Payslips** | Every completed payment automatically becomes verifiable proof of income                    |
| **QR Payments**      | Workers generate a QR code that employers can scan and pay without needing a Stride account |
| **Income Reports**   | Signed PDF reports of received payments that can be verified        |

The worker registers for Stride once, links their Open Payments wallet address, and can generate a QR code. They share that QR with any employer as their "payment card". Every payment they receive automatically becomes a payslip in their Stride dashboard, that they can download as a pdf.

The employer scans the worker's QR code, which opens a public payment page in their browser. They enter their own wallet address and the amount, then approve the transfer through their bank's normal consent screen. 

---

## How It Works

Every payment follows the Open Payments flow:

1. Sender and receiver both have Interledger wallet addresses.
2. The app requests a grant to create an incoming payment on the receiver's account.
3. A quote is generated showing the exact amount and fees upfront.
4. The sender approves the payment via a GNAP interactive grant.
5. An outgoing payment is created and funds move directly between accounts.
6. Both parties receive an immutable transaction record.

## Demo Accounts

You need two accounts to demo Stride — one for the worker (Nomsa) and one
for the employer (Sarah). Create them by running the commands below in
PowerShell, one at a time.

> **Before running these:** Make sure the backend is running on
> http://localhost:3001

### Create the worker account

Copy and paste this entire block into PowerShell and press Enter:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"email":"nomsa@stride.com","password":"password123","displayName":"Nomsa Dlamini"}' -UseBasicParsing
```

You should see `StatusCode: 201` in the response. That means it worked.

### Create the employer account

Copy and paste this entire block into PowerShell and press Enter:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"email":"employer@stride.com","password":"password123","displayName":"Sarah Johnson"}' -UseBasicParsing
```

You should see `StatusCode: 201` in the response.

### Account credentials

| Account | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Worker | nomsa@stride.com | password123 |
| Employer | employer@stride.com | password123 |

> **Note:** You can also create accounts directly through the app at
> http://localhost:5173/signup — but you will still need to set the
> wallet address manually using the commands in the next section.

---
## Setting Wallet Addresses

After creating accounts, each user needs their Interledger wallet address linked to their profile.

Run these commands, replacing the wallet addresses with your own:

**Worker account:**
```powershell
$r = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"email":"nomsa@stride.com","password":"password123"}' -UseBasicParsing
$token = ($r.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).token
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/me" -Method PATCH -ContentType "application/json" -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $token"} -Body '{"walletAddress":"https://ilp.interledger-test.dev/YOUR_WORKER_HANDLE"}' -UseBasicParsing
```

**Employer account:**
```powershell
$r = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"email":"employer@stride.com","password":"password123"}' -UseBasicParsing
$token = ($r.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).token
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/me" -Method PATCH -ContentType "application/json" -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $token"} -Body '{"walletAddress":"https://ilp.interledger-test.dev/YOUR_EMPLOYER_HANDLE"}' -UseBasicParsing
```

> Both commands should return StatusCode 200 with the wallet address confirmed in the response.

## Demo Flow

### 1. Worker Generates QR Code
> **Before the demo:** Log in as Nomsa, go to **My QR Code**, and click 
> **Generate My QR Code**. This creates her payment page at 
> `http://localhost:3001/pay/nomsa-dlamini`.

1. Log in as **Nomsa**
2. Navigate to **My QR Code**
3. Click **Generate My QR Code**
4. Display or download the QR code

### 2. Employer Pays via QR

1. Scan the QR code or open:

```text
http://localhost:3001/pay/nomsa-dlamini
```

2. Enter:

   * Name
   * Wallet address
   * Amount
   * Work description
3. Click **Pay Now**
4. Approve the payment in the Interledger test wallet.
5. Payment confirmation is displayed.

### 3. Worker Views Payslip

1. Log in as **Nomsa**
2. Navigate to **Income History**
3. Select **View**
4. Review the generated payslip and transaction details.

### 4. Download Proof of Income

1. Navigate to **Income Report**
2. Select a date range
3. Click **Download PDF Report**
4. The report is generated with an HMAC signature.
5. Lenders can verify authenticity via the verification URL.

## Using QR Codes on Real Devices (ngrok)

To scan Nomsa's QR code with a real phone, you need to expose your local
backend to the internet using ngrok.

### Step 1 — Install ngrok

Download ngrok from the Microsoft Store or from https://ngrok.com/download

### Step 2 — Create a free ngrok account

Sign up at https://ngrok.com and get your auth token from:
https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

### Step 3 — Add your auth token

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### Step 4 — Start the tunnel

```bash
ngrok http 3001
```

You will see output like:

```
Forwarding  https://abc123.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:3001
```

Copy the `https://` URL.

### Step 5 — Update your environment

Open `stride-backend/backend/.env` and update:

```
BACKEND_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
```

### Step 6 — Restart the backend

Stop the backend with Ctrl+C and restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 7 — Regenerate the QR code

Log in as Nomsa, go to **My QR Code**, and click **Regenerate**. The QR
now encodes the public ngrok URL.

### Step 8 — Scan with your phone

Point any smartphone camera at the QR code. Your browser will open the
Stride payment page. Enter your wallet address, amount, and work
description, then click **Pay Now** and approve at the test wallet.

After approval your phone will show a payment confirmation screen.
Nomsa's income history updates automatically.

> **Important:** Free ngrok gives a new URL every time you restart the
> tunnel. You must update `BACKEND_URL` in `.env` and regenerate the QR
> code each time.

> Start ngrok first, update `.env`, restart the backend,
> then regenerate the QR before the presentation begins.

## Key Design Decisions

### Employer Requires No Stride Account

The QR code contains a standard HTTPS URL. Any smartphone camera can open the payment page, and Stride orchestrates the Open Payments flow.

### No Balance Exposure

Stride never stores or accesses wallet balances. Wallet providers retain full custody and privacy.

### Tamper-Evident Reports

PDF reports are signed with HMAC-SHA256 and can be independently verified without contacting Stride.

### One Wallet Address for Everything

A single wallet address powers:

* Incoming payments
* QR payments
* Financial history
* Portable identity across providers
