## Overview

Stride enables domestic workers, day labourers, and gig workers to:

* Receive secure digital payments
* Automatically generate verifiable proof of income
* Build a portable financial history
* Access loans, housing, and financial services without requiring a traditional bank account

Every user receives an Interledger wallet address that works across banks, mobile money providers, and digital wallets.

## Problem Statement

In South Africa, **5.7 million people were in informal employment in Q4:2025**, while the informal sector accounted for **21.4% of all jobs**. In addition, **1.9 million South Africans were running non-VAT registered businesses in 2023**. Many of these workers are paid in cash with no verifiable record of income, which makes it difficult to prove earnings.

Without proof of income, workers are often locked out of housing, credit, and basic financial services. The informal economy remains essential to South Africa’s livelihoods, yet the people driving it are still financially invisible because their earnings rarely leave a formal paper trail.

Without verifiable income records or payslips, they often cannot:

- Rent formal housing.
- Qualify for loans or credit.
- Access basic financial services.

## Our Solution

Stride combines three core tools into one platform.

| Feature              | Description                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Digital Payslips** | Every completed payment automatically becomes verifiable proof of income                    |
| **QR Payments**      | Workers generate a QR code that employers can scan and pay without needing a Stride account |
| **Income Reports**   | Signed PDF reports of received payments that can be verified        |

## How It Works

Every payment follows the Open Payments flow:

1. Sender and receiver both have Interledger wallet addresses.
2. The app requests a grant to create an incoming payment on the receiver's account.
3. A quote is generated showing the exact amount and fees upfront.
4. The sender approves the payment via a GNAP interactive grant.
5. An outgoing payment is created and funds move directly between accounts.
6. Both parties receive an immutable transaction record.

  -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup" `
  -Method POST `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"email":"nomsa@stride.com","password":"password123","displayName":"Nomsa Dlamini"}'

# Employer account
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup" `
  -Method POST `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"email":"employer@stride.com","password":"password123","displayName":"Sarah Johnson"}'
```

## Using QR Codes on Real Devices

Expose the backend using ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 3001
```

Update `backend/.env`:

```env
BACKEND_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app
```

Restart the backend and regenerate the QR code.

> **Note:** Free ngrok URLs change after every restart, so QR codes must be regenerated.

## Key Design Decisions

### Employer Requires No Stride Account

The QR code contains a standard HTTPS URL. Any smartphone camera can open the payment page, and Stride orchestrates the Open Payments flow.

### No Balance Exposure

Stride never stores or accesses wallet balances. Wallet providers retain full custody and privacy.

### Tamper-Evident Reports

PDF reports are signed with HMAC-SHA256 and can be independently verified without contacting Stride.

### One Wallet Address for Everything

A single wallet address powers:

* Incoming payments
* QR payments
* Financial history
* Portable identity across providers
